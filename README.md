**About Dataset**

This dataset contains 100k dielectron events in the invariant mass range 2-110 GeV for use in outreach and education. These data were selected for use in education and outreach and contain a subset of the total event information. The selection criteria may be different from that used in CMS physics results.

**Features**

  ***Run:*** The run number of the event.
  
  ***Event:*** The event number.
  
  ***E1, E2:*** The total energy of the electron (GeV) for electrons 1 and 2.
  
  ***px1,py1,pz1,px2,py2,pz2:*** The components of the momemtum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
  
  ***pt1, pt2:*** The transverse momentum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
  
  ***eta1, eta2:*** The pseudorapidity of the electron 1 and 2.
  
  ***phi1, phi2:*** The phi angle of the electron 1 and 2 (rad).
  
  ***Q1, Q2:*** The charge of the electron 1 and 2.
  
  ***M:*** The invariant mass of two electrons (GeV).
